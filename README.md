3. Once the Summme vertical toolbar appears and the microphone icon is highlighted red at the bottom right of your screen you can begin chatting.

## Step 2: Keyboard Shortcuts

If the chatbot is in read aloud mode, the microphone input is in paused mode. 

The stop the read aloud and resume chatting use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Space` to stop the read aloud and unpause microphone. 

This is also a toggle shortcut that you can use to stop and replay the audio.
