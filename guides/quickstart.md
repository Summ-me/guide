# Start Voice Chatting


## Step 1: Sign in & Pin to Sidebar

We recommend before you start chatting to create an account with Summ.me to get the most out of this app. This includes having access to:
- Chat history & search
- AI Prompt and Answer assist
- And more

Secondly, for easier access to features, we also recommend pinning the Summme icon to your toolbar.

3. Once the Summme vertical toolbar appears and the microphone icon is highlighted red at the bottom right of your screen you can begin chatting.

## Step 3: Keyboard Shortcuts

If the chatbot is in read aloud mode, the microphone input is in paused mode. 

The stop the read aloud and resume chatting use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Space` to stop the read aloud and unpause microphone. 

This is also a toggle shortcut that you can use to stop and replay the audio.
